# P4HW2 â€“ Employee Pay Calculator
# This program calculates regular pay, overtime pay, and gross pay for multiple employees.
# It uses a sentinel-controlled loop to keep collecting employee data until the user types "Done".
# At the end, it summarizes total regular, overtime, and gross payments for all employees.

# ---------- Pseudocode ----------
# Initialize counters:
#   - total_employees = 0
#   - total_overtime_pay = 0.0
#   - total_regular_pay = 0.0
#   - total_gross_pay = 0.0
# While True:
#     Ask for employee name (if "Done", break)
#     Ask for hours worked
#     Ask for pay rate
#     If hours > 40:
#         - Calculate overtime hours = hours - 40
#         - Regular hours = 40
#     Else:
#         - Overtime = 0
#         - Regular hours = hours
#     Calculate:
#         - overtime_pay = overtime hours * pay rate * 1.5
#         - regular_pay = regular hours * pay rate
#         - gross_pay = overtime_pay + regular_pay
#     Display formatted results for the employee
#     Add to totals
# After loop ends:
#     Display total employees and total pays (overtime, regular, gross)
