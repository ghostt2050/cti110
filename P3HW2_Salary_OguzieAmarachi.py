# and overtime pay based on hours worked and hourly rate.

# ----------- Pseudocode -----------
# 1. Get employee's name
# 2. Get hours worked
# 3. Get pay rate
# 4. If hours worked > 40:
#       - Calculate overtime hours = hours worked - 40
#       - Overtime pay = overtime hours * pay rate * 1.5
#       - Regular pay = 40 * pay rate
#    Else:
#       - Overtime hours = 0
#       - Overtime pay = 0
#       - Regular pay = hours worked * pay rate
# 5. Gross pay = regular pay + overtime pay
# 6. Display results in formatted output
